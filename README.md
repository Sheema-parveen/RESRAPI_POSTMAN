# RESTAPI_POSTMAN
RESTAPI using postman

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for different application to communicate with each other over the internet. It allows one application to request and receive information or perform actions on another application, using simple, consistent rules.

Postman is a popular API client tool that makes it easier for developers to create, share, test, and document APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for building and testing HTTP requests, making it a valuable tool for API development and testing. 

HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
GET: Retrieve a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource.
DELETE: Delete a resource.

REST APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:
200 OK: The request was successful.
201 Created: A resource was successfully created.
204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error and could not complete the request.
